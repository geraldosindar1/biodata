      <h2>All about Bunny or Rabbit</h2>

      <p>
        Rabbits, also known as bunnies or bunny rabbits, 
        are small mammals in the family Leporidae (along with the hare) of the order Lagomorpha 
        (along with the pika). Oryctolagus cuniculus includes the European rabbit species and its descendants, 
        the world's 305 breeds[1] of domestic rabbit. Sylvilagus includes 13 wild rabbit species, 
        among them the seven types of cottontail. The European rabbit, which has been introduced 
        on every continent except Antarctica, is familiar throughout the world as a wild prey animal and 
        as a domesticated form of livestock and pet. With its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, 
        the rabbit is, in many areas of the world, a part of daily lifeâ€”as food, clothing, 
        a companion, and a source of artistic inspiration.
